# pic//sl
picsl was a pixel sorting program that would sort images in real time. It was coded using javascript and an SVG & animation library called [Paperscript](http://paperjs.org/reference/paperscript/). The main source code for the algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/m-ttriley/picsl/blob/master/algo.js)

### Unfortunately, pic//sl is no longer live
### However, the general idea is I took photos like this:
![picsl before photo](http://m-ttriley.github.io/picsl_before.jpg)

### And turned them into something this in real time:
![picsl before photo](http://m-ttriley.github.io/picsl_after.png)
