# pic//sl
## Unfortunately, pic//sl is no longer live
### However, the general idea is I took photos like this:
![picsl before photo](http://m-ttriley.github.io/picsl_before.jpg)

### And turned them into something this in real time:
![picsl before photo](http://m-ttriley.github.io/picsl_after.png)
  
watch your images get sorted in real time
